I asked these questions to just get to know the user as the interviewer. Each of these questions can relate to how the user's personality or thought proccess over multiple things might be. This can help both the user and interviewer get to know each other pretty well. This app is solely made to get to know the user or just to ask fun and easy questions to answer wether its by typing it out or saying it outloud. The data is saved but can also be restted depending on the users liking or preference.
